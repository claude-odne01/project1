              The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, often referred to as The Guggenheim, is an art museum at 1071 Fifth Avenue 
              on the corner of East 89th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. It is the permanent home of a
              continuously expanding collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, early Modern, and contemporary art and also
              features special exhibitions throughout the year. The museum was established by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation 
              in 1939 as the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, under the guidance of its first director, Hilla von Rebay. It adopted its
              current name in 1952, three years after the death of its founder Solomon R. Guggenheim.
              <br /><br />
              In 1959, the museum moved from rented space to its current building, a landmark work of 20th-century architecture
              designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The cylindrical building, wider at the top than at the bottom, was conceived as a
              "temple of the spirit". Its unique ramp gallery extends up from ground level in a long, continuous spiral along the
              outer edges of the building to end just under the ceiling skylight. The building underwent extensive expansion and
              renovations in 1992 when an adjoining tower was built, and from 2005 to 2008.
              <br /><br />
              The museum's collection has grown over eight decades and is founded upon several important private collections,
              beginning with that of Solomon R. Guggenheim. The collection is shared with sister museums in Bilbao, Spain and
              elsewhere. In 2013, nearly 1.2 million people visited the museum, and it hosted the most popular exhibition in New York
              City.

              Rebay conceived of the space as a "temple of the spirit" that would facilitate a new way of looking at the modern pieces
              in the collection. She wrote to Wright that "each of these great masterpieces should be organized into space, and only
              you ... would test the possibilities to do so. ... I want a temple of spirit, a monument!" The critic Paul
              Goldberger later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, "there were only two common models for museum design:
              Beaux-arts Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion." Goldberger thought the building a catalyst for change,
              making it "socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum.
              In this sense almost every museum of our time is a child of the Guggenheim."
              <br /><br />
              The spiral design recalled a nautilus shell, with continuous spaces flowing freely one into another. Even as it
              embraced nature, Wright's design also expresses his take on modernist architecture's rigid geometry. Wright ascribed
              a symbolic meaning to the building's shapes. He explained, "these geometric forms suggest certain human ideas, moods,
              sentiments - as for instance: the circle, infinity; the triangle, structural unity; the spiral, organic progress; the
              square, integrity." Forms echo one another throughout: oval-shaped columns, for example, reiterate the geometry of
              the fountain. Circularity is the leitmotif, from the rotunda to the inlaid design of the terrazzo floors. Several
              architecture professors have speculated that the helical ramp and glass dome of Giuseppe Momo's 1932 staircase at the
              Vatican Museums was an inspiration for Wright's ramp and atrium. Jaroslav Josef Pol√≠vka assisted Wright with
              the structural design and managed to design the gallery ramp without perimeter columns.
